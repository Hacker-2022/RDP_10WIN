<details>
    <summary>Using Multiple Profiles</summary>
<br>

* Each profile operates independently with its own credentials and state
* To create a new profile, simply run the workflow with a different profile name
* Profiles are stored in the `miner-state/<profile>` directory
* To stop a running profile, create a file named `stop.flag` in the profile's directory

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Using Secrets for Credentials</summary>
<br>

* You can set repository secrets for persistent credentials:
  - `LITEMANAGER_ID`: Your LiteManager ID
  - `LITEMANAGER_PASS`: Your LiteManager password
* When these secrets are set, they will be used instead of generating new credentials

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Repository Bloat Protection</summary>
<br>

* Automatic log rotation keeps your repository size manageable
* Logs older than 3 days are automatically cleaned up
* Files larger than 1MB are excluded from git tracking
* Run `cleanup_logs.bat [profile] [days] [size_kb]` manually to clean up logs
* Example: `cleanup_logs.bat default 7 2048` cleans logs for the default profile older than 7 days or larger than 2MB

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Fallback Credential Generation</summary>
<br>

* If no credentials file exists and no GitHub Secrets are provided, random credentials will be generated
* These credentials are saved to the profile's directory for future use
* This ensures the system always has valid credentials to operate with
